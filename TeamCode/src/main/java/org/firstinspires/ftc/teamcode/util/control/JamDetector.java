/**
 * Current-based stall detection with bounded automatic un-jamming.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is not inside Intake</h2>
 * It is the most intricate logic on the robot — three pieces of timing state, an attempt counter,
 * and an eligibility rule that is wrong in two different directions if you get it backwards — and
 * inside a class holding a {@code DcMotorEx} none of it could be tested. Here it is pure state and
 * arithmetic, so every branch below is covered by {@code JamDetectorTest} without a robot. Same
 * reasoning as {@link VisionMath} and {@link PoseFusion}; the story is in {@code docs/09}.
 *
 * <h2>How it decides</h2>
 * High current alone is not a jam — a motor accelerating from rest draws stall current for a moment.
 * So over-current must <em>persist</em> for {@code stallTimeoutMs} before it counts. Once it does,
 * the caller is told to reverse for {@code unjamDurationMs}, and that is one attempt. Current
 * dropping back below the threshold clears both the timer and the attempt count, so the limit
 * bounds <em>consecutive</em> failed attempts rather than attempts over the whole match.
 *
 * <h2>The eligibility rule is load-bearing</h2>
 * The caller passes {@code eligible}, and must only pass true while actively intaking. Holding a
 * captured game piece against a hard stop is, by definition, a stalled motor: a detector that ran
 * during HOLDING would see hold current, declare a jam, and spit the piece straight back out.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   detector.configure(STALL_AMPS, STALL_MS, UNJAM_MS, MAX_ATTEMPTS);
 *   if (detector.update(now, mode == Mode.INTAKING, amps)) {
 *       motor.setVelocity(UNJAM_TICKS_PER_SEC);
 *   } else {
 *       motor.setVelocity(targetVelocity);
 *   }
 * </pre>
