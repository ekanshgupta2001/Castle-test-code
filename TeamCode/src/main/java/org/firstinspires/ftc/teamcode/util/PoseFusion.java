/**
 * Blends wheel/Pinpoint odometry with AprilTag position fixes.
 *
 * <h2>Why not just call setPose()</h2>
 * Writing a vision pose straight into the follower teleports the robot's belief. One bad frame and
 * the next path drives somewhere arbitrary. Odometry is smooth but drifts; vision is absolute but
 * noisy and late. Fusing keeps the good half of each.
 *
 * <h2>Position is fused; heading is not</h2>
 * Only X and Y go through the filter. Heading is taken from odometry unchanged, for two reasons:
 * a Pinpoint's fused IMU heading is far better than a tag-derived one, and angles wrap at 0/2pi,
 * which a scalar Kalman filter handles badly — a filter straddling the seam would average 359 and 1
 * into 180 and point the robot backwards. Avoiding the problem beats patching it.
 *
 * <h2>Latency</h2>
 * A camera fix describes where the robot <em>was</em> when the shutter opened, typically 60-120 ms
 * ago. At 40 in/s that is several inches. This class keeps a short history of odometry samples,
 * looks up where the robot was at capture time, and applies the vision-minus-history offset to the
 * <em>current</em> odometry — so the correction lands in the present.
 *
 * <p>Pure math apart from Pedro's {@link KalmanFilter} and {@link Pose}, both of which are plain
 * Java, so all of this is unit-testable off-robot.
