/**
 * Angle arithmetic that respects the wrap at 0/2pi.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is its own class</h2>
 * These three functions used to live in {@link VisionMath}, which meant field geometry, heading
 * hold, and macro targeting all imported a class named "VisionMath" to do arithmetic that has
 * nothing to do with a camera. The name misdescribed half its contents, and a student copying the
 * pattern would learn the wrong lesson about where general math belongs.
 *
 * <h2>The wrap is the whole point</h2>
 * Two conventions meet in this codebase and disagree:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Math.atan2} returns {@code (-pi, pi]}</li>
 *   <li>Every {@code Pose} Pedro hands back is in {@code [0, 2pi)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Mix them and a naive comparison breaks. Worse, a controller fed a raw angle difference across the
 * seam sees 359 degrees and 1 degree as 358 degrees apart and drives the long way round at full
 * power. {@link #angleError} always takes the short way; {@link #normalizeAngle} puts an angle in
 * Pedro's convention. Pure arithmetic, no hardware, fully unit tested.
