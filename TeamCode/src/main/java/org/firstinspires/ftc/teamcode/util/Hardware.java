/**
 * Fail-soft hardware lookup.
 *
 * <p>{@code hardwareMap.get(...)} throws when a device is missing or misnamed in the robot
 * configuration. Because subsystems are built in {@link org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.Robot}'s
 * constructor, one bad name used to take down the entire OpMode before it ever ran — so a broken
 * colour sensor cost you the whole driver-controlled period.
 *
 * <p>This helper returns {@code null} instead and records the name. Subsystems null-check the
 * handle and quietly no-op, so the robot still drives with a missing camera. {@link #getMissing()}
 * feeds the diagnostics OpMode, which reports exactly which config entry is wrong.
 *
 * <p><b>Call {@link #reset()} before constructing subsystems.</b> The registry is static (it has to
 * outlive individual subsystem constructors), so without a reset it accumulates entries across
 * OpMode runs. {@code Robot}'s constructor does this for you.
