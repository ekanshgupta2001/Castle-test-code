/**
 * Rolling median over the last N samples. Pure math, no hardware — unit-tested.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a median and not a low-pass.</b> Pedro ships {@code LowPassFilter} and
 * {@code KalmanFilter}, and either is the right tool for smoothing a continuously noisy signal.
 * Vision detections do not fail that way: they are usually good and occasionally <em>completely</em>
 * wrong — a reflection, a partially occluded blob, a frame caught mid-exposure. An averaging filter
 * pulls those outliers into the output; a median throws them away entirely, which is what we want
 * before committing the robot to a path.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #isReady()} to require a full window before acting. Acting on one frame is how a
 * single bad detection sends the robot at a wall.
