/**
 * Carries the robot's pose and alliance from autonomous into teleop.
 *
 * <p>Without this, teleop starts with no idea where the robot is — and it defaults to field-centric
 * drive, which is the mode that depends most on a correct heading. The driver's first stick input
 * then sends the robot in an arbitrary direction.
 *
 * <p><b>Lifetime:</b> static state, so it survives between OpMode runs but <em>not</em> a Robot
 * Controller restart or an app crash. Teleop must therefore treat a missing value as normal and fall
 * back to AprilTag localisation or a manual heading reset — never assume this is populated.
 *
 * <p>Autonomous should call {@link #save} continuously rather than once at the end, so the handoff
 * still works if the OpMode is stopped early — which is exactly when a match is most chaotic.
